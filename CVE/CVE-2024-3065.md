title: CVE-2024-3065
subtitle: PayPal Pay Now, Buy Now, Donation and Cart Buttons Shortcode <= 1.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
---
## Description
The PayPal Pay Now, Buy Now, Donation and Cart Buttons Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

## Severity
 4.4 (Medium) - [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
