subtitle: Tabellen von faustball.com <= 2.0.4 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
---
## Description
The Tabellen von faustball.com plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
