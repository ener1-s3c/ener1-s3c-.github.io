title: CVE-2024-3023
subtitle: AnnounceKit <= 2.0.9 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
---
## Description
The AnnounceKit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

## Severity
 4.4 (Medium) - [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

## Affected Version
    <= 2.0.9

## PoC :
```
- Install AnnounceKit
- Go To Settings/AnnounceKit
- Add Widget
- Input payload <script>alert('eneriiiiii<3')</script> on widget name
- Payload executed.
```
